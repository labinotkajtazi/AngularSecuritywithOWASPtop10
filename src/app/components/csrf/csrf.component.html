      <h4 class="mark"><strong>-Cross Site Request Forgery-</strong></h4>
      <p class="text-info">Cross Site Request Forgery takes advantage of session Id's which are stored once on user login,therefore leaving
         the attacker able to send requests to the server as if the user himself had. The server only recognizes users through the session cookie leaving no indication of a breech.
        The way to protect your application from these types of attacks requires that both the server and client side work together. A unique CSRF token that cannot be copied
        by the attacker must be generated. Because certain operations can only be done on the same domain of the JavaScript application we can be sure that a real user 
        is sending the request. If the request does not contain said token, or custom request header generated by token, the server will not recognize the request as a valid one.</p>
